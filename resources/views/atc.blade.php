                </div>

                <p>
                    <strong>“SLOT”</strong> is a permission given by a coordinator for a planned operation to use the
                    full range of airport infrastructure necessary to arrive or depart at a Level 3 airport
                    on a specific date and time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Classification of Airports: For the purpose of slot allocation, airports are generally
                    categorized according to the following levels of congestion:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Level 1: where the capacity of the airport infrastructure is generally
                        adequate to meet the demands of airport users at all times.</li>
                    <li>Level 2: where there is potential for congestion during some periods of the
                        day, week, or season which can be resolved by voluntary cooperation
                        between airlines.</li>
                    <li>Level 3: where capacity is constrained due to lack of sufficient
                        infrastructure.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2><strong>Slot Allocation System</strong></h2>

                <p>
                    With the increase in air traffic at the major airports in the country, the
                    capacity of these airports has become constrained. Therefore, to ensure the most
                    efficient use of airport infrastructure and in order to maximize benefits to the
                    greatest number of airport users, it is essential to have a policy for allocation of
                    constrained or limited airport capacity to airlines and other aircraft operators
                    through a transparent and equitable mechanism so as to ensure viable airport and
                    air transport operations.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    An airport should be categorized into different levels by a responsible
                    authority and by following a thorough demand and capacity analysis, and full
                    consultation with all stakeholders and interested parties. The airport should be
                    designated as Level 3 only if this analysis and consultation concludes that the
                    demand for airport infrastructure significantly exceeds available capacity and there
                    is no practical way to alleviate the problem in the short term. The airport capacity
                    should be made available in the public domain through websites.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For Level 3 airports, a Coordinator is required to be designated to allocate
                    slots to airlines and other aircrafts operators using or planning to use the airport as
                    a means of managing available capacity. An airport slot would therefore mean a
                    permission given by a Coordinator for a planned operation to use the full range of 
                    3
                    airport infrastructure necessary to arrive or depart at a Level 3 airport on a specific
                    date and time. The procedure should be devised in a manner that there is enough
                    appellate mechanism inbuilt in the system.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It may be understood that coordination is not a solution to the fundamental
                    problem of a lack of airport capacity. In all instances, coordination should be seen
                    as an interim solution to manage congested infrastructure until the longer term
                    solution of expanding airport capacity is implemented.
                </p>

                <h3><strong>Slot Allocation Guidelines</strong></h3>

                <p>
                    These Guidelines forms the slot allocation and management standard for
                    Indian coordination, and should therefore be duly noted and implemented in full
                    by all affected Indian airports and air carriers using such airport infrastructure.
                    The Guidelines have been formatted to reflect international best practice and in
                    accordance with the recommendations of the IATA Worldwide Slot Guidelines
                    (WSG), as amended twice yearly. The WSG is the globally adopted standard for
                    efficient slot allocation to optimize the use of severely congested airport
                    infrastructure worldwide.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These guidelines are expected to maximize efficiency in the process of slot
                    allocation, promote sustainable competition and encourage growth of air
                    connectivity to remove and inaccessible regions of the country, while ensuring
                    viability of operations of the airlines.

                </p>

                <h2><strong>Worldwide Airport Slots</strong> </h2>

                <p>
                    Each year, over 1.5 billion passengers - 43% of global traffic - depart from over 200 slot coordinated airports. The number of slot coordinated airports is expected to grow significantly due to a lack of expansion in airport infrastructure to cope with increasing demand.
                </p>

                <p>
                    IATA is at the forefront of ensuring a fair, neutral and transparent allocation of airport slots at the worlds’ most congested airports through the application of the Worldwide Slot Guidelines (WSG).
                </p>

                <p>
                    By having the same set of rules at both the departure and arrival airport, the WSG allow airlines to plan their whole network and schedule, and provide choice and connectivity to the passengers.
                </p>

                <h2><strong>OUR ROLE</strong></h2>

                <p>
                    IATA provides the global air transport industry with the Worldwide Slot Guidelines (WSG), a single set of guidelines for airport slot management and allocation. The slot planning process is the essential back bone to allow the industry to plan operations to the world’s most congested airports, avoiding what would otherwise be chaos.
                </p>

                <h3><strong>IATA is actively involved in a range of activities including:</strong></h3>

                <ul>

                    <li>Supporting the implementation of one single global standard.</li>
                    <li>Running the twice-yearly Slot Conference to allow airlines and coordinators to meet face-to-face to review their slot portfolio and finalize their future schedules.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2><strong>Worldwide Airport Slots and IATA Committees and Work Groups</strong></h2>

                <h3><strong>Slot Policy Working Group (SPWG)</strong></h3>

                <p>
                    The Slot Policy Working Group is the industry group responsible for guiding IATA’s slot policy and strategic direction, and providing technical guidance on scheduling and slot related matters. This group brings together the airline slot community to discuss and define response to key issues, policies, emerging trends as well as to identify and set out the priorities for action. The group is also the airline industry’s voice for maintaining the Worldwide Slot Guidelines (WSG). The SPWG meets four times a year, including at both Slot Conference events.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Main functions of the SPWG:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Set the airline direction and policy on all issues related to the slot process</li>
                    <li>Provide guidance on future initiatives and strategy</li>

                <h2><strong>Functions Of Air traffic Controller:</strong></h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>Airport Levels - looking at how to ensure that airports that are currently not congested (or at least not congested all the time) can continue to grow and provide the connectivity and services that consumers want without having to impose the complex allocation processes that have to be used for fully congested (Level 3) airports</li>
                    <li>Historic Determination - reviewing the current processes involved in retaining slots and how to ensure best use of scarce capacity to promote connectivity and choice to the customer</li>
                    <li>Slot Performance Monitoring – how best to ensure that airlines use their slots as allocated, without penalising airlines for unforeseen ‘on the day’ operational factors (e.g. air traffic control congestion, tech aircraft, strikes or bad weather)</li>
                    <li>Access to Congested Airports – looking at enhancing the process for allocating slots to airlines wishing to get access to congested airports, whilst maintaining transparent and clear rules for all</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><strong>Air Traffic Flow Management slot allocation to minimize propagated delay and improve airport slot adherence</strong></h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>A model for Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) slot allocation is proposed.</li>
                    <li>At the first level model minimizes propagated delay by utilizing schedule buffers.</li>
                    <li>At the second level model maximizes airport slot adherence of regulated flights.</li>
                    <li>Aircraft Operators benefit from such approach in terms of propagated delay savings.</li>
                    <li>Results challenge the current European ATFM delay minimization policy.</li>
                </ul>
